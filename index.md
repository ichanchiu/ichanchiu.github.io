## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at Fu Jen Catholic University, starting from August 2025. My research integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and textual analysis, with asset pricing and financial economics.

My work aims to leverage computational techniques to extract novel insights from financial data, addressing complex challenges in investment analysis and market behavior. My Ph.D. in Finance from National Taiwan University laid the groundwork for my current research agenda.

Prior to my academic career, I gained extensive industry experience at Fubon Financial Holding and SinoPac Securities, where I led fintech projects, including a robo-advisor, and conducted macroeconomic analysis. This dual background in academia and industry uniquely positions me to bridge theoretical research with practical applications.
